# FarmGamesProject

## Project Overview

FarmGamesProject is a Python-based automation tool for interacting with Telegram-based games. It automatically launches selected games, interacts with them according to predefined strategies, and collects rewards or performs other game-specific tasks.

## Features

- **Game Selection Menu**: A user-friendly interface for selecting which games to launch.
- **Automated Telegram Interaction**: Automatically finds and launches the Telegram Desktop application.
- **Game Strategies**: Customizable strategies for each game, allowing automated interaction with game-specific logic.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of the entire process, including errors and actions taken.

## Key Naming Conventions
- Game Folders: Each game folder within the games/ directory must be named after its corresponding bot's ID (e.g., ava_ethernity_bot).
- Configuration Files: Inside each game folder, a config.json file must be present, containing all necessary settings for that game.
- Strategy Files: The strategy for each game should be implemented in a strategy.py file within the respective game's folder.

## How to Use
- Set up the Environment: Make sure to set up the virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
- Configure Games: Ensure that each game has a config.json file under its respective directory in games/. This file should contain the necessary configuration for the bot to operate correctly.
- Run the Project: Launch the project using the main.py file. This will open the game selection menu where you can select which games to automate.
- Logging: All actions and errors are logged to logs/project.log. Check this file to debug issues or review what the bot has done.

## Adding New Games
To add support for a new game:
- Create a new directory under games/ named after the bot ID (e.g., ava_ethernity_bot).
- Add a config.json file with the necessary configuration settings. Implement a strategy.py file that defines the specific actions the bot should take for this game, subclassing from game_strategy.py.
- Update the README.md file if necessary to reflect the changes.
